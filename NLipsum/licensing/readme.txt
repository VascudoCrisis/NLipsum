Version 0.9.0.0 :: September 26, 2007 :: RC 1

Hello.
This library is licensed under the MIT license.  

It was created because I couldn't find a Lipsum generator to my liking written for .NET.
I am fond of the 'Lipsum - The Text Generator' which is a Python application (http://lipsum.sourceforge.net/)
Thus, I based this library loosely around that implementation.  
All of the prepackaged Lipsums were taken from that project.

Hopefully this will facilitate some of your content-generating needs.

Feel free to send suggestions, thanks, licensing violations and constructive criticism.
